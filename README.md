Cat's Administration Tools Public Release

This is the release of the admin mod I use on my sandbox server. It takes cues from a G12 admin mod named ASSMod.
I intended to make this because I personally find ULX cluttered. Place "catv1" in the addons folder of your server.

To open the admin menu, simply type bind g +cat_menu into console, then hold G.

About Screen Capture

Finally changed it. Admins now get the screenshot directly after taking it. Welcome to the digital age folks.

READ ME ABOUT THE CONFIG
---
By default, the config is set up for a classic sandbox server. If you're running a DarkRP or something else that
ISN'T SANDBOX, you're going to want to go into the config and change some stuff (such as not allowing users and
vip to noclip). All of the possible "cando" options are listed in the "CAT_Config.OwnerCan" table.
