Cat's Administration Tools Public Release

This is the release of the admin mod I use on my sandbox server. It takes cues from a G12 admin mod named ASSMod.
I intended to make this because I personally find ULX cluttered. Place "catv1" in the addons folder of your server.

To open the admin menu, simply type bind g +cat_menu into console, then hold G.

Features
---
* Standard Abilities(Slay, Rocket, Blind, Cloak, Kick, Ban, etc.)
* Client Screen Capture
* A pretty much unbreakable config.
* An easy to use UI.
* Offline Ban Management (garrysmod/data/cat/bans)

About Screen Capture
---
I'm probably going to get a lot of flak for releasing a Screen Capture ability, mainly because it's considered an
"invasion of privacy". Just be aware that using the Screen Capture ability, nobody can use it except for the Owner
Usergroup (by default), and that it can only be accessed by going to the actual server directory, and getting the
file from there. I figured this would give people enough solace about it.

READ ME ABOUT THE CONFIG
---
By default, the config is set up for a classic sandbox server. If you're running a DarkRP or something else that
ISN'T SANDBOX, you're going to want to go into the config and change some stuff (such as not allowing users and
vip to noclip). All of the possible "cando" options are listed in the "CAT_Config.ownerCan" table.
