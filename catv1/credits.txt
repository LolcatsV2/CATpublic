Thanks to Meggido, Stickly Man, and everyone who worked on ULX, for spurring me want to make something that (tries to) surpass ULX in neatness. Also for the player send code.

Thanks to everyone at Metastruct for having the weirdest bunch of coders I've ever seen, and supplying me with what I needed to make this. You guys make some neat shit though.

Thanks to everyone who replied initially in my Facepunch thread, and gave me constructive feedback.

Thanks to FPtje, who has one of the most... creative... ways of doing Prop Protection.

Thanks especially to: SpiralP, Nano, and the 65 users that joined my Sandbox server just to be turned into test dummies.
